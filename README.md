< Problem >
1. Women realistic hands not working on my project.
To interact with Canvas UI in unity, I have to use the Player prefab (SteamVR/InteractionSystem/Core/Prefabs/Player.prefab).

But I don't know how i can apply your assets to this prefab.
I was trying to apply the your hands, it is not working animation and like that.. also i got an error from unity.
